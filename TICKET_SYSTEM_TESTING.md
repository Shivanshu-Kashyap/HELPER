# AI Ticket System - Testing Guide

## Overview
This document outlines how to test the complete AI-powered ticket system workflow.

## System Architecture

### Backend Flow
1. **User creates ticket** â†’ `POST /api/tickets`
2. **Ticket saved to DB** â†’ MongoDB with status "TODO"
3. **Event sent to Inngest** â†’ `ticket/created` event
4. **Inngest processes ticket**:
   - Fetches ticket from DB
   - Runs AI analysis using Gemini
   - Updates ticket with AI insights (priority, skills, notes)
   - Assigns to moderator based on skills
   - Sends email notification
   - Updates status to "IN_PROGRESS"

### Frontend Flow
1. **User Dashboard** â†’ Create and view own tickets
2. **Moderator Dashboard** â†’ View assigned tickets with stats
3. **Admin Dashboard** â†’ Manage all users and tickets
4. **Ticket Details** â†’ View AI analysis and moderator can provide solution

5. âœ… Moderator assigned based on skills
6. âœ… Email notification sent
7. âœ… Moderator reviews and provides solution
8. âœ… Ticket marked as "RESOLVED"
9. âœ… User sees solution

### AI Analysis Expected Output
For a ticket about React issues, AI should provide:
- **Priority**: medium or high
- **Skills**: ["React", "JavaScript", "Frontend"]
- **Notes**: Detailed technical explanation with potential solutions
- **Summary**: Brief description of the issue

### Error Recovery
- AI parsing fails â†’ Fallback values used
- No matching moderator â†’ Assigned to any moderator or admin
- Email fails â†’ Logged but doesn't block ticket processing
- Inngest fails â†’ Ticket remains in TODO status for manual processing

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: AI parsing always fails
**Solution**: Check `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly in `.env`

### Issue: No moderator assigned
**Solution**: Ensure at least one user has role "moderator" with skills matching ticket

### Issue: Email not sent
**Solution**: Check Mailtrap credentials in `.env`:
- `MAILTRAP_SMTP_HOST`
- `MAILTRAP_SMTP_PORT`
- `MAILTRAP_SMTP_USER`
- `MAILTRAP_SMTP_PASS`

### Issue: Ticket stuck in TODO
**Solution**: Check Inngest dashboard or logs for processing errors

### Issue: Frontend can't fetch tickets
**Solution**: Verify `VITE_SERVER_URL` in frontend `.env` points to correct backend URL

## Environment Variables Checklist

### Backend (.env)
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://...
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key
MAILTRAP_SMTP_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAILTRAP_SMTP_PORT=2525
MAILTRAP_SMTP_USER=your-user
MAILTRAP_SMTP_PASS=your-pass
PORT=3000
```

### Frontend (.env)
```
VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

## Testing Tips

1. **Use Browser DevTools**: Monitor network requests and console logs
2. **Check Backend Logs**: Watch terminal for processing steps
3. **Use Postman/Thunder Client**: Test API endpoints directly
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Empty values, special characters, very long text
5. **Test Permissions**: Login as different user roles
6. **Monitor Database**: Check MongoDB to verify data updates
7. **Check Inngest Dashboard**: View event processing status

## Success Metrics

- âœ… All tickets get AI analysis within 5 seconds
- âœ… 100% of tickets assigned to appropriate moderator
- âœ… Email notifications sent within 10 seconds
- âœ… No tickets stuck in processing
- âœ… All permissions properly enforced
- âœ… All error states handled gracefully
- âœ… User feedback clear and helpful

## Next Steps After Testing

If all tests pass:
1. âœ… System is production-ready
2. Consider adding more features:
   - Ticket comments/discussion
   - File attachments
   - Ticket categories
   - SLA tracking
   - Analytics dashboard
